## Installation

Instructions to come.

``` {r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}

pgk <- "file/path/to/package"
install.packages(pkg, 
                 # this indicates to R that the package is being installed 
                 # from a local path
                 repos = NULL, 
                 # and this confirms that you are installing from source,
                 # as opposed to the many other formats R packages can take
                 type = "source")  
```
